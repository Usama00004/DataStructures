searching by index in array is O(1)
searching by value in array is O(n)
triversal in array is O(n)
insertion in array is O(n)                  arr.insert(index,value)
deletion in array with index is O(n)        arr.remove(index) 

static array doesnot exist in python
dynamic arrays are called list in python

Concept  : Dynamic arrays follow the concept of Geometric progression
          initially it is fixed but when the space is finished previous array 
          is copied to a new sapce with more memory spaces and new value is added
